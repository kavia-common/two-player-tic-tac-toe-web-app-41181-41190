# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### CI-friendly usage

- Development server: `npm run start:ci` (binds to HOST=0.0.0.0, uses REACT_APP_PORT if set, disables auto-open)
- Production build: `npm run build:ci` (respects REACT_APP_ENABLE_SOURCE_MAPS; set to false in CI to reduce memory usage)

These variants help avoid resource-related terminations (exit code 137) in CI by reducing overhead and preventing manual kills. If port 3000 is occupied in CI, set `REACT_APP_PORT` to a free port.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Note: The build script suppresses outdated Browserslist database warnings in CI to avoid noisy logs that may cause strict pipelines to fail. To update the Browserslist DB locally, run:
`npx update-browserslist-db@latest`

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
